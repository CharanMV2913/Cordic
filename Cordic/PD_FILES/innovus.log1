Route type trimming info:
  The following route types were modified by the autotrimmer:
    clkroute (M3-M6) was replaced by clkroute_ccopt_autotrimmed (M3-M5);
      Layer M6 is trimmed off because its RC characteristic is very different from its adjacent layers.
  To disable this behavior, either reduce the range of allowed layers or set the property "route_type_autotrim" to false.
Found no blackbox sink pins.
