addStripe will allow jog to connect padcore ring and block ring.

Stripes will not extend to closest target.
When breaking rings, the power planner will consider the existence of blocks.
addStripe will break automatically at non-default domains when generating global stripes over the core area or default domain.
The entire stripe set will break at the domain if one of the nets is not in the domain.
Stripes will not be created over regions without power planning wires.
Offset for stripe breaking is set to 0.
Stripes will stop at the boundary of the specified area.
The power planner will set stripe antenna targets to none (no trimming allowed).

    For

    In

    case
    the

    number
    of

    will
    be

    the

    only
    those

    satisfying
    the
    -min_slack

    will
    be
    reported.
    The
    software
    will
    not
    process
    paths
    beyond
    the

    limit
    to

    other

    and

    is

    then
    only

    be
    reported;
    path
    with
    slack
    value
    of

    Here,
    even

    with
    slack
    that
    is
    greater
    than

    then
    it
    will
    not

    because

    the
    worst
    path
    to
    each
    pin-to-pin

    reported.
    
    When
    from-to
    pins

    specified,
    the
    software
    will
    trace
    across
    the
    trigger
    arcs
    and
    report
    a
    path,
    if
    there
    is
    a
    clock
    reaching
    the
    CK
    pin
    of
    the
    trigger
    arc.
    However,
    if
    there
    is
    a
    begin
    or
    end
    point
    present
    between
    the
    -from
    and
    -to
    pins,
    the
    software
    will
    not
    trace
    beyond
    it.
    
    If
    there
    is
    no
    clock
    reaching
    the
    CK
    pin
    of
    the
    trigger
    arc,
    the
    software
    cannot
    trace
    across
    the
    trigger
    arc,
    and
    no
    path
    is
    reported.
    Additionally,
    clock
    path
    delay
    is
    included
    only
    when
    the
    clock
    is
    in
    propagated
    mode.
    
    The
    -point_to_point
    parameter
    can
    be
    used
    with
    the
    -max_paths
    and
    -nworst
    parameters.
    
    Note:
    The
    -point_to_point
    and
    -through
    parameters
    are
    mutually
    exclusive;
    you
    cannot
    specify
    them
    together.
    
    Note:
    The
    -point_to_point

    supports
    a
    single
    -from

    a

    In

    the

    reported
    during
    graph-based

    The
    default
    timing
    analysis
    uses
    worst-case
    slew
    propagation
    to
    calculate
    the
    delays
    at
    each
    stage.
    As
    a
    result,
    timing
    analysis
    results
    can
    be
    pessimistic.
    
    Note:
    This
    feature
    should
    be
    run
    only
    on
    paths
    that
    are
    not

    simply

    incremental
    delays
    can
    be
    recomputed

    You
    can
    use
    the
    following

    signal

    In
    the

    the
    Retime

    reports
    recomputed

    To

    specify
    the

    The
    -retime

    also
    supports
    retiming

    This
    option
    does
    not
    retiming
    an

    This

    works
    in
    graph-based

    (GBA)

    You
    can
    use
    the

    report_timing

    A

    of
    the
    timing

    generated
    in
    GBA

    The
    same

    will
    reflect
    the

    of
    the
    timing

    report
    in
    PBA

    The

    -
    under
    the
    timing_report_retime_formatting_mode
    retime_replace

    Note:
    For
    memory

    purposes,
    both
    the

    will
    not
    be

    option,
    the

    Using

    edge
    of

    in
    pin_list.
    
    The
    pin_list
    is
    a
    logical
    OR

    The
    resulting

    may
    pass
    through
    any
    of
    the
    pins
    or
    nets
    in
