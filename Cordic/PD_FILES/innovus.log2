Route type trimming info:
  The following route types were modified by the autotrimmer:
    clkroute (M3-M6) was replaced by clkroute_ccopt_autotrimmed (M3-M5);
      Layer M6 is trimmed off because its RC characteristic is very different from its adjacent layers.
  To disable this behavior, either reduce the range of allowed layers or set the property "route_type_autotrim" to false.
Found no blackbox sink pins.

Logging CTS constraint violations...
  Clock tree clk has 1 slew violation.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1007):	Did not meet the max transition constraint. Found 35 slew violations below cell CTS_ccl_a_buf_00040 (a lib_cell CLKBUFX16) at (45.600,54.720), in power domain auto-default with half corner BEST:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin gen_pipe[1].Pipe_Yo_reg[9]/CK with a slew time target of 0.052ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.052ns.
